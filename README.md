### Description

We're working on a social media app called ILUVUS, which focuses on celebrating racial minorities and marginalized communities like the LGBTQ+. Our goal is to connect these diverse communities in a world where discrimination and intolerance are still prevalent. ILUVUS aims to address this issue by promoting positivity, celebrating achievements, and combatting discrimination.

We're developing our own platform instead of using existing ones because they don't prioritize the celebration and recognition of these communities' accomplishments. Our focus is on offering a unique user experience that celebrates diversity. By doing this, we can ensure strict moderation of hateful posts and messages and promote positivity effectively.

## Getting Started

- **React Native**: A JavaScript framework for building mobile applications that can run on both iOS and Android platforms.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

* NodeJS
* NPM

#### To run:
* Optional: Expo App on [iOS]( https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) and [Android]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1)
* iOS Simulator on Mac OS only
* Android Studio Android Simulator or any Android Studio on Mac OS, Windows, or Linux
